Page 107:
     In Figure 4.25, change  Left to Right on the line
     T->Right = Delete( X, T->Left );

Page 211:
     In the IsEmpty block, the return statement should
     return -Infinity, not H.

Page 247:
     Remove "insertion" from caption in Figure 7.17.

Page 252:
     Next to last figure, change 51 to 41.

Page 258:
     In Exercise 7.19 (b), change "nondisinct" to "distinct".

In chapter 8 (and the index):
     Ackerman is misspelled.  It should be Ackermann.

Page 288:
     In Figure 9.5, change FindNewVertexOfDegreeZero to
     FindNewVertexOfIndegreeZero.

Page 371:
     In Figure 10.33, change "coordinates differ" to "y-coordinates differ"

Page 391:
     In Figure 10.53, remove the word const from the first parameter.
     Logically it makes sense, but because of an obscure C rule,
     some arguments of type TwoDimArray would not be acceptable as a parameter.

Many of the .h specs are missing a #define immediately after the #ifndef.
I've fixed this in the online code.

Page 7:
     Last equation is missing i^2 after summation symbol.

Page 65: In Figure 3.41 (fixed in online code)
     Prior to the call to MakeEmpty, need S->Next=NULL;

Page 68: Line -4, change "four" to "five".

Page 79: Figure 3.56
     Enqueue needs an additional parameter X.

Page 93: In Figure 4.7, change entries of the form
     chr?.c to ch?.r

Page 111: Change .328 to 1.328

Page 134 and 135:
     In many of the 2-3 trees, the middle link from 41:58 is missing.

Page 181:
     Figure labelled 6.4 should be 6.4a.

Page 181:
     Figure 6.5: right tree should have 6 in node that contains 24.

Page 183:
     In caption of Figure 6.8, change key to heap.

Page 209:
     Change "binary queues" to "binomial queues"

Page 237:
     There is a missing ( before Left+Right 4 lines prior to Section 7.7.2.

Page 255:
     In Figure 7.18, change 75 to 15, everywhere.

Page 287:
     In Figure 9.4, reverse the arrows so the edges are (v1,v3) and (v5,v4).

Page 288:
     Change "all edges adjacent to v have their indegrees decremented" to
     Change "all vertices adjacent to v have their indegrees decremented"

Page 417:
     Exercise 10.38, replace "random" with "rand"

Page 421:
     Exercise 10.55, in the example, change "txtborkk" to 
     "txtborpk" and delete "p" instead of "k"

Page 453:
     In last line remove (as shown in Chapter 4).

Page 479:
     In Figure 12.33, the link from node 40 to 45 should be
     from node 50 to 45.

Page 483:
     When T is logically a leaf, it is rotated with the RIGHT
     child, not the left. The rest of the paragraph, and the code is correct.
